## Prerequisites

-   [Trongate framework](https://github.com/davidjconnelly/trongate)
-   [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com)

## Installation

### Windows

Copy snippet files to %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User

### MacOSX

Copy snippet files to ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Sublime Text 3 Snippets

### Linux

Copy snippet files to ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Sublime Text 3 Snippets

## Usage

When you use these snippets inside *Sublime Text* within HTML files, or HTML within PHP, simply use the less than sign(<). As soon you start typing, it will display all the snippets.
